# Hash Sum Mismatch Errors When Building Ubuntu 24.04 and Debian Stable Images on Docker Desktop for Mac

## Description
When attempting to build Docker images with either Ubuntu 24.04 or Debian Stable as base images on Docker Desktop for Mac, the build process fails with package hash sum mismatch errors. The issue appears consistently across different Linux distributions, suggesting a problem with Docker Desktop for Mac's handling of package downloads or verification.

## Environment
- Docker Desktop for Mac Version: [Your Version]
- macOS Version: [Your Version]

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Create Dockerfiles with Ubuntu 24.04 and Debian Stable as base images
2. Add standard package installation commands (gcc, g++, python, etc.)
3. Run build commands for both images
4. Observe hash sum mismatch errors in the build logs
